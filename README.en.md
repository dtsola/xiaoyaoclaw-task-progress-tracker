## Why you need it

Every AI agent session starts fresh. Without progress tracking, your work will:
- ❌ **Lost context** — tasks half-done across sessions, no way to resume
- ❌ **Scattered documents** — reports and docs buried in random folders, impossible to find later
- ❌ **No traceability** — "what did I do on this task last week?" — gone
- ❌ **Heavy tools** — full project-management suites (CLI + external services) are overkill for a file-based workflow

This skill solves it in one go: **directory as container + PROGRESS.md progress card + document index**.

## Features

- 📁 **Two objects** — tasks (30 min ~ 1 week, short-lived) and projects (> 1 week, continuously maintained)
- 🗂️ **Directory as container** — `tasks/<slug>/`, `projects/<slug>/` are the task/project themselves, no parallel structure
- 📋 **PROGRESS.md progress card** — frontmatter (status / progress / docs) + append-only progress log + document index
- 🔗 **Document index** — machine-readable (YAML `docs` array) + human-readable (index table) dual channel
- 🚦 **Restrained creation** — only responds to explicit instructions, no global skill hooks (lesson learned from v1)
- 🪶 **Zero dependency** — pure file operations, no CLI, no external services, no database
- 🏠 **Sister-skill synergy** — pairs with workspace-initializer (directory rules) and memory-distill (memory distillation)

## Install

```bash
# From ClawHub (recommended)
clawhub install xiaoyaoclaw-task-progress-tracker

# Or manually from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/dtsola/xiaoyaoclaw-task-progress-tracker
# Put SKILL.md and templates/ into your skills directory
```

## Usage

Tell your agent in plain language:

| You say | What happens |
|---------|-------------|
| "Start a task: research XX" | Creates `tasks/xx/` + PROGRESS.md card |
| "Create a project: XX platform" | Creates `projects/xx/` + PROGRESS.md card |
| "Task XX progress: research done, writing report" | Appends progress log + updates timestamp |
| "Attach a doc to XX: outputs/xxx.png is the result" | Moves doc into `docs/` + writes index |
| "What tasks/projects are running?" | Summarizes all active cards |
| "Where is XX project now?" | Reads the PROGRESS.md and reports |
| "Task XX is done" | Marks done + logs to today's memory file |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the skill

```bash
clawhub install xiaoyaoclaw-task-progress-tracker
```

### Step 2: Create your first task

Tell your agent:

> start a task: research XX

It will create `tasks/xx/PROGRESS.md` with status active.

### Step 3: Maintain daily

Say a progress update, attach a doc — the agent keeps the card updated. Open any PROGRESS.md to see status, timeline, and document index at a glance.

## How it compares

| | v1 (deprecated) | **v2 (this)** |
|---|---|---|
| Status carrier | PROGRESS.md (dual-track: status layer × content layer) | ✅ PROGRESS.md as the only card (status + log + index in one) |
| Creation trigger | any skill activation = create entry (false positives) | ✅ explicit user instruction / clear expectation only |
| Documents | not managed | ✅ docs/ index (cairn artifact idea, no CLI) |
| Dependencies | none | ✅ none (stays lightweight) |
